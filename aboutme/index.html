        <h2>Joschua Kleine</h2>
        <p>Heya everyone!</p>
        <p>I'm Joschua, 22 and I live in Germany, pretty far up north, close to the Danish border. Since I was a kid I enjoyed working and experimenting with Computers a lot, so I decided to now finally implement that into my studies, after it being one of my hobbies for such a long time.</p>
        <p>Besides using Computers for actual work, I enjoy playing video games a lot, I'm currently on a nostalgia trip with re-experiencing Skyrim and Shadow of Mordor. I'm also a huge fan of watching movies, reading books and exercising various sports like football (the real one ;), volleyball or track and field.</p>
        <p>I was born into the church and have been a member my whole life, last year in February I finished my mission to the Russia Novosibirsk Area, which I really loved and enjoyed.</p>
